# Web Map Application 

In this map I have designed an interactive web map of airports in the United States. For each airport feature, the field CNTL_TWR indicates wheter the airport has an air traffic control tower or not. If there is a tower, the value of CNTL_TWR is 'Y', otherwise 'N'. Us-states.geojson is a geojson data file containging all the states boundaries of the United States. THis data is acquired from Mike Bostock of D3. The count field indicates the number of airports within the boundary of the state under investigation.
